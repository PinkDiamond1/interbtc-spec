.. _Vault-registry:

Vault Registry
==============

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The vault registry is the central place to manage vaults. Vaults can register themselves here, update their collateral, or can be liquidated.
Similarly, the issue, redeem, refund, and replace protocols call this module to assign vaults during issue, redeem, refund, and replace procedures.
Morever, vaults use the registry to register public key for the :ref:`okd` and register addresses for the :ref:`op-return` scheme.

Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~

Constants
---------

Scalars
-------

MinimumCollateralVault
......................

The minimum collateral a vault needs to provide to participate in the issue process. 

.. note:: This is a protection against spamming the protocol with very small collateral amounts. Vaults are still able to withdraw the collateral after registration, but at least it requires an additional transaction fee, and it provides protection against accidental registration with very low amounts of collateral.

PunishmentDelay
.................

If a Vault fails to execute a correct redeem or replace, it is *temporarily* banned from further issue, redeem or replace requests. This value configures the duration of this ban (in number of blocks) .

.. _SecureCollateralThreshold:

SecureCollateralThreshold
.........................

Determines the over-collateralization rate for collateral locked by Vaults, necessary for issuing tokens. 

The Vault can take on issue requests depending on the collateral it provides and under consideration of the ``SecureCollateralThreshold``.
The maximum amount of interbtc a vault is able to support during the issue process is based on the following equation:

:math:`\text{max(interbtc)} = \text{collateral} * \text{ExchangeRate} / \text{SecureCollateralThreshold}`.

* The Secure Collateral Threshold MUST be greater than the Liquidation Threshold.
* The Secure Collateral Threshold MUST be greater than the Premium Redeem Threshold.

.. note:: As an example, assume we use ``DOT`` as collateral, we issue ``interBTC`` and lock ``BTC`` on the Bitcoin side. Let's assume the ``BTC``/``DOT`` exchange rate is ``80``, i.e., one has to pay 80 ``DOT`` to receive 1 ``BTC``. Further, the ``SecureCollateralThreshold`` is 200%, i.e., a vault has to provide two-times the amount of collateral to back an issue request. Now let's say the vault deposits 400 ``DOT`` as collateral. Then this vault can back at most 2.5 interBTC as: :math:`400 * (1/80) / 2 = 2.5`.


.. _PremiumCollateralThreshold:

PremiumRedeemThreshold
......................

Determines the rate for the collateral rate of Vaults, at which users receive a premium, allocated from the Vault's collateral, when performing a :ref:`redeem-protocol` with this Vault. 

* The Premium Redeem Threshold MUST be greater than the Liquidation Threshold.

.. _LiquidationThreshold:

LiquidationThreshold
....................

Determines the lower bound for the collateral rate in issued tokens. If a Vaultâ€™s collateral rate drops below this, automatic liquidation is triggered.

* The Liquidation Threshold MUST be greater than 100% for any collateral asset.

LiquidationVault
.................

Account identifier of an artificial vault maintained by the VaultRegistry to handle interbtc balances and DOT collateral of liquidated Vaults. That is, when a vault is liquidated, its balances are transferred to ``LiquidationVault`` and claims are later handled via the ``LiquidationVault``.


.. note:: A Vault's token balances and DOT collateral are transferred to the ``LiquidationVault`` as a result of automated liquidations and :ref:`reportVaultTheft`.

Vaults
......

Mapping from accounts of Vaults to their struct. ``<Account, Vault>``.

``status``                 VaultStatus         Current status of the vault (Active, Liquidated, CommittedTheft)
=========================  ==================  ========================================================

.. note:: This specification currently assumes for simplicity that a vault will reuse the same BTC address, even after multiple redeem requests. **[Future Extension]**: For better security, Vaults may desire to generate new BTC addresses each time they execute a redeem request. This can be handled by pre-generating multiple BTC addresses and storing these in a list for each Vault. Caution is necessary for users which execute issue requests with "old" vault addresses - these BTC must be moved to the latest address by Vaults.
