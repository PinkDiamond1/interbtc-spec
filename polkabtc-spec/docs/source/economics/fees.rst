Fee Model
=========

We assume Vaults and Staked Relayer to be economically driven, i.e., following a strategy to maximize profits over time. While there may be altruistic actors, who follow protocol rules independent of the economic impact, we do not consider these here.

Byzantine actors aim to manipulate the system and cause damage to users - independent of the economic impact this has on them. To showcase how misbehavior impacts the fees earned by participants, we also consider byzantine behavior of Vaults and Staked Relayers in this analysis.
