Governance
==========

Overview
~~~~~~~~

On-chain governance is useful for controlling system parameters, authorizing trusted oracles and upgrading the core protocols. The architecture adopted by interBTC is modelled on Polkadot, which allows for a **Council** and **Technical Committee** to propose referenda which are voted on by holders of the native governance token.

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Referenda** describe system updates and are actively voted on by the community.
- **Motions** are council-led proposals to launch external referenda OR approve / reject treasury proposals.
- **Public Proposals** are community-supported proposals to launch referenda.

Processes
~~~~~~~~~

Elections
---------

1. Account submits candidacy for council (requires ``CandidacyBond``)
2. Token holders vote on council members (currency is locked)
3. Election is triggered after ``TermDuration``
4. Council is elected via the sequential Phragm√©n method

Council
-------

1. A councillor creates a motion to trigger next external referendum
2. Council votes on motion
3. Council closes motion on success or failure
4. New referenda are started every ``LaunchPeriod``
5. Community can vote on referenda for the ``VotingPeriod``
6. Votes are tallied after ``VotingPeriod`` expires
7. System update executed after ``EnactmentPeriod``
8. Token voters can unlock balance after ``end + EnactmentPeriod * conviction``

Technical Committee
-------------------

1. Council votes on motion as above
2. Technical Committee may fast track before ``LaunchPeriod``
3. The new referenda is immediately baked
4. Community can vote on referenda for the ``FastTrackVotingPeriod``

Treasury
